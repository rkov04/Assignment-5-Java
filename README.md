Welcome to the metric unit converter!

This program was made for the purose of converting metric units into imperial units.

To start, run the program!
It will first ask you to type the conversion that you are needing.
For example, if you want to convert grams to ounces, type 'g = oz'.
Next, it will ask you how many units you want to convert.
For example, if you have chosen grams to ounces, and you want to convert 3 grams, simply type '3'.
The program will then output the chosen number of units into it's imperial equivalent!

Type 'exit' at any time to go back out and choose a differnet conversion, or to exit the program altogether.

Have fun converting!
